# Overview

This app is a group dating app. It is currently just a skeleton for the finished app. In the end, users will be able to join a lobby of guys and girls and be placed on a team of both genders. The teams will play dating-oriented mini games together. At the end of the game, users will have the ability to send match invites to plays on either team of the opposite gender to match romantically, allowing them to start a private conversation thread like in any dating app.

This dating app will allow you to break the ice with users before ever considering matching with them and messaging one-on-one.
